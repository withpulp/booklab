## MVP

**Note:** This is still a work in progress.

### Subscriptions

```
When I'm looking for a new book  
I want to find books from people I look up to  
So that I can be sure the book is relevant to my interests
```

```
When I'm looking for people I look up to  
I want to search for them by their full name, display name, or email address
So that I can find them easily
```

```
When I find someone that I look up to  
I want to be able to follow them  
So that I can see their book recommendations appear in real-time
```


### Book Wall

```
When a book is shared  
I would like it to include a title and author  
So I can do my own research on the book
```

```
When a book is shared  
I want to see a short description from the person who recommended it  
So I can see whether it is something I'd like
```

```
When a book is shared  
I would like to see the genre of the book and other books within that genre  
So I can see similar books that I may like
```

```
When a book is shared  
I would like a link to Amazon or other retailers  
So I can gauge other reviews and easily make a purchasing decision
```

```
When a book is shared  
I would like to see if others said anything about it  
So I can get a better picture of what it's like
```

### Reading List

```
When there are book recommendations I like  
I want to be able to add them a reading list  
So that I can have a list of books to read in the future
```

```
When there are books in my reading list  
I want to be able to sort them based on my interest  
So my reading list becomes meaningful
```

```
When there are books in my reading list  
I want to be able to sort them by rating, genre, recommender  
So that I can make more sense of the books
```

### Notifications

```
When a person I admire has posted a new book  
I want to be notified through email
So that I can review their recommendations easily
```

### Social
```
When a book is shared on my wall  
I would like to be able to chat with the recommender about that book  
So that I can have a productive, on-going conversation
```

```
When I've read a book that I like  
I would like to share it on my public wall 
So they can benefit as I did
```

## Technical Outline

### Collections

This is still a work in progress.

* Books - users can post their books
    * title
    * author
    * genre
    * description
    * amazon/barnes noble link
    * userId(recommender)
    * username(recommender)
    * date(now)
    * userRating
    * commentsCount(0)
* Relationships - users can subscribe to each other
    * userId(follower)
    * userId(leader/recommender)
* Bookmarks - reading list for liked books
    * pull data from Books
    * date(now)
* Comments - comments from users on books
* Notifications - notify when leader/recommender posted a new book (email and via app)

## How to use

### Requirements

Make sure [Meteor is installed and up to date](https://www.meteor.com/install) or run:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:amazingBastard/booklab.git
cd mtr-booklab
meteor
```

### Deployments

It is highly recommended to use [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) for easy deployments.
Have a look at the repository for more information.

### SEO and other concerns

> Meteor cannot do SEO

This statement is only partially true, since there is a package called [ms-seo](https://github.com/DerMambo/ms-seo), which
has a lot of neat little tricks to help web crawlers notice your app the way you want them to. Use constants under
__client/lib/constants.js__ for the app. Change SEO settings inside the routes like that.

```javascript
Router.route('/about', function () {
  this.render('about');
  // Using the app constants
  SEO.set({ title: 'About -' + Meteor.App.NAME, og: {...} });
});
```

### Adding allow rules for external URLs

The [browser-policy](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/browser-policy) adds rules to deny all operations from external URLs.
This helps dealing with clickjacking and other XSS methods used to attack the client. To whitelist a url, add following to
__server/config/security.js__

```javascript
BrowserPolicy.content.allowOriginForAll(YOUR_URL);
```

Other security enforcing packages like [audit-argument-checks](https://docs.meteor.com/#/full/auditargumentchecks) and
[matteodem:easy-security](https://github.com/matteodem/meteor-easy-security) have also been added.
